## [TODO] Drivetrain Coordinate Systems

TODO: there are about 4-5 coordinate systems used... need docs clearly defining the linkage between everything.

* field coordinates
* robot coordinates
* NavX coordinates
* Joystick coordinates
* swerve drive definition coordinates
* how we do red vs blue coordinates, what is +x, +y for red vs blue to make things easy to program?
* Oak-D camera coordinates and how to translate that to something usable... cross-references with tutorials for navigation with auto.
