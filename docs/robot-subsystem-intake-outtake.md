## [TODO] Intake Outtake

TODO: Example of intake/outtake and challenges.  Maybe talk about the intake / outtake on eclipse and how we have rollers, and then get rollers to another state / position so that the other rollers can get up to speed.  Note that this would not be an exhaustive example and a definition of how it must be done, but a guide on how to do intake / outtake.  As we get more intake / outtake mechanisms, we can add more docs here under this section.
