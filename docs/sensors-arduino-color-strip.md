## [TODO] LED Color Strip

TODO: demo of how do do a LED color strip 
* control the led color for the purpose of bling / fancy stuff... 
* control the led color strip based off of sensor values obtained by I2C sensors or other sensors plugged into the arduino and processed onboard so we can do that on the arduino and keep the robot java code focused on robot stuff.
