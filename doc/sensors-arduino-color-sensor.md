## [TODO] Arduino Color Sensors

TODO: Docs on how to do an arduino color sensor... how do you have smarter sensors and data processing on the arduino so that you don't need to do it in java / python and then output to the DIO instead of the I2C or PWM.

By giving a simple command to robo rio, then we can have smart automation on the robo rio.

Also... if we do it in the arduino... the arduino can control other electronics subsystems such as the LED board or color strip for improved driver feedback.
